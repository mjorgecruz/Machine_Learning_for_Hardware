# GitHub Roadmap: Bridging Machine-Learning & Hardware (12-Month Plan)

> **Purpose**‚ÄÉThis roadmap turns the 12-month learning plan into concrete GitHub deliverables‚Äîissues, milestones, and repos you can share with recruiters.  
> **Structure**‚ÄÉWe use one umbrella *Roadmap* repo that links out to focused project repos created along the way.

---
## üìÇ Repository Layout
| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **roadmap-ml-hw** *(this repo)* | Issues, milestones, meeting notes, and high-level docs like this one. |
| **phase1-math-ml-basics** | Jupyter notebooks & scripts for foundational math + first CNN on CIFAR-10. |
| **efficient-ml-inference** | Quantization & cloud-based inference experiments (MobileNetV2, TensorRT/TVM, AWS/Paperspace). |
| **paper-replication-rt-detr** | Research replication + cloud deployment optimization. |
| **ml-cloud-tools** | Cloud workflows (Docker, W&B, training orchestration, model deployment). |

*(Additional repos will be created if a project grows too large.)*

## üóÇÔ∏è GitHub Project Board (Kanban)
**Columns**
1. **Backlog** ‚Äì Ideas & papers to read  
2. **Ready** ‚Äì Clearly defined tasks (PRD, acceptance criteria)  
3. **In Progress** ‚Äì Assigned & under active work  
4. **Review** ‚Äì Open PR awaiting code or paper review  
5. **Done** ‚Äì Merged PR / submitted paper / blog published

Create the board in **roadmap-ml-hw ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí ‚ÄúML-HW 2025‚Äù**.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Milestones & Core Deliverables
| Milestone | Deadline | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **M0 Setup** | **Week 1** | Roadmap repo + project board + high-level issues |
| **M1 Foundations** | **Month 3** | ‚Ä¢ `phase1-math-ml-basics` repo  
‚Ä¢ Blog post #1 (linear regression from scratch) |
| **M2 Efficient Inference (Cloud)** | **Month 6** | ‚Ä¢ `efficient-ml-inference` repo  
‚Ä¢ Model benchmark comparison (CPU vs GPU, quantized vs float32)  
‚Ä¢ Demo video + blog post #2 |
| **M3 Research Replica** | **Month 9** | ‚Ä¢ `paper-replication-rt-detr` repo  
‚Ä¢ Tech report draft (.md ‚Üí .pdf)  
‚Ä¢ Cloud-based training + analysis |
| **M4 Publish & Share** | **Month 12** | ‚Ä¢ ArXiv submission  
‚Ä¢ Conference workshop submission  
‚Ä¢ Portfolio README refresh |

Each repo gets its own **README ‚Üí Issues ‚Üí Project** mini-board, but milestones are tracked centrally here.

## üìà Issues to Create Right Away
1. **[#1] Bootstrap workspace** ‚Äì Set up Conda env, VS Code devcontainer.
2. **[#2] Cloud training setup** ‚Äì Spin up EC2 or Paperspace instance with GPU.
3. **[#3] ft_linear_regression warm-up** ‚Äì Re-implement & annotate 42‚Äôs ML intro project ([github.com](https://github.com/leogaudin/ft_linear_regression?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
4. **[#4] Python for Data Science exercises** ‚Äì Port selected modules from 42 Madrid project into notebooks ([github.com](https://github.com/karisti/42_python_for_datascience)).
5. **[#5] Draft blog template (Jekyll)** ‚Äì For future posts.

*(Tag each issue with `phase:X` and link to milestones.)*

## üéì 42 School ML/Data-Science Projects‚ÄîWorth Including?
| 42 Project | Why Include? | Suggested Phase |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **ft_linear_regression** | Quick intro to gradient descent; easy blog/tutorial content. | Phase 1 |
| **Python for Data Science** | Solidifies NumPy/Pandas/Matplotlib; good repo for newcomers. | Phase 1 |
| **k-means workshop (42AI)** | Adds unsupervised learning; useful for clustering/representation. | Phase 1-2 |
| *(Others: logistic regression, OCR mini-project, etc.)* | Optional; only include if helpful to reinforce foundational understanding. | Phase 1 |

> **Rule of thumb:** Only import a 42 project if it teaches something *directly useful* for later ML systems or cloud deployment goals.

---
## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Knowledge Integration
| Phase | Cloud Task |
|-------|------------|
| Phase 2 | ‚Ä¢ Spin up EC2 or Paperspace instance  
‚Ä¢ Use Docker to create ML inference environments  
‚Ä¢ Benchmark models remotely |
| Phase 3 | ‚Ä¢ Train paper replication model in the cloud  
‚Ä¢ Log results using W&B or MLflow |
| Phase 4 | ‚Ä¢ Compare cloud vs edge performance (in blog)  
‚Ä¢ Deploy blog with GitHub Actions + gh-pages |

Use free or low-cost GPU tiers (Paperspace, Google Colab Pro+, Hugging Face Spaces).

## üîÑ Maintenance Rhythm
- **Weekly**: Triage issues, move cards, update progress in README badges.
- **Bi-weekly**: Write short changelog & share on Twitter/L-town Slack groups.
- **Monthly**: Close a milestone, tag release, sync blog/pr.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Automation Tips
- Enable **GitHub Actions** for: linting, unit tests, model benchmark CI, blog deploy to `gh-pages`.
- Use **Dependabot** for Python deps.
- Set up **Codecov** for coverage.

---
## üìÉ License & Community
- Default license: MIT for code, CC-BY-4.0 for notebooks/posts.
- Add a **CONTRIBUTING.md** for future collaborators (ML Collective, peer contributors).

*Start by creating the `roadmap-ml-hw` repo, copy this document into `ROADMAP.md`, and open the five starter issues.*

Happy hacking! üöÄ
